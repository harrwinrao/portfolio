  content: '
    <p class="lead">
    My area of focus lies in designing and implementing backend logics for web based products. While my superpower lies in the brains of a program (i.e The backend logic), 
    I also believe good looks are just as important (i.e The front end UI). I enjoy designing and coding the UI and backend logic as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
